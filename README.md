<h1>What was done in this project? </h1>

In summary, this project is the conversion of non-dynamic html templates prepared for admin and e-commerce into dynamic php codes. There are English and Turkish variable definitions in this project. I plan to add security updates to this repository as I find time. Although most of the user view is in English, the tables I have created are in Turkish. To avoid confusion, I mostly used Turkish variable names. https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/gentelella has been used for the admin panel. License information is added below.
